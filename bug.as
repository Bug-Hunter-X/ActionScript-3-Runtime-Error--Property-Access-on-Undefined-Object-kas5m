The following ActionScript 3 code attempts to access a property of an object that may not exist, resulting in a runtime error. This is a common issue when dealing with dynamic data or external data sources where the structure may be unpredictable.

```actionscript
// Example: Accessing a property that might not exist

var myObject:Object = getExternalData(); // Get data from an external source

var value:String = myObject.someProperty; // Access a property

// The above code will throw an error if myObject does not contain the 'someProperty'
```
